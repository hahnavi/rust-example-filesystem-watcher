This Rust code snippet sets up a file system watcher using the `notify` crate and asynchronous programming with the `futures` crate. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

### Imports
- **`futures::channel::mpsc::{channel, Receiver}`**: Imports the `channel` function to create a channel for asynchronous communication, and the `Receiver` type for receiving messages from the channel.
- **`futures::{SinkExt, StreamExt}`**: Provides extension traits for working with `Sink` and `Stream` types, such as `send` and `next`.
- **`notify::{Config, Event, RecommendedWatcher, RecursiveMode, Watcher}`**: Imports types and traits from the `notify` crate to create and configure a file system watcher.

### `main` Function
1. **Path Argument**: Reads a file path from the command-line arguments. If the path is not provided, it panics with a message.
   ```rust
   let path = std::env::args()
       .nth(1)
       .expect("Argument 1 needs to be a path");
   ```
2. **Execution**: Uses `futures::executor::block_on` to run the asynchronous `async_watch` function in a blocking context.
   ```rust
   futures::executor::block_on(async {
       if let Err(e) = async_watch(path).await {
           println!("error: {:?}", e)
       }
   });
   ```

### `async_watcher` Function
1. **Create Channel**: Sets up a channel with a buffer size of 1. `tx` is the sender, and `rx` is the receiver.
   ```rust
   let (mut tx, rx) = channel(1);
   ```
2. **Create Watcher**: Initializes a `RecommendedWatcher` with a closure that sends events to the channel.
   ```rust
   let watcher = RecommendedWatcher::new(
       move |res| {
           futures::executor::block_on(async {
               tx.send(res).await.unwrap();
           })
       },
       Config::default(),
   )?;
   ```
   - The closure is executed whenever an event occurs.
   - `futures::executor::block_on` is used here to block on the asynchronous send operation.

3. **Return Values**: Returns the watcher and the receiver.
   ```rust
   Ok((watcher, rx))
   ```

### `async_watch` Function
1. **Initialize Watcher**: Calls `async_watcher` to get a `RecommendedWatcher` and a `Receiver`.
   ```rust
   let (mut watcher, mut rx) = async_watcher()?;
   ```
2. **Watch Path**: Starts watching the specified path recursively.
   ```rust
   watcher.watch(path.as_ref(), RecursiveMode::Recursive)?;
   ```
3. **Handle Events**: Processes events from the receiver in a loop.
   ```rust
   while let Some(res) = rx.next().await {
       match res {
           Ok(event) => println!("changed: {:?}", event),
           Err(e) => println!("watch error: {:?}", e),
       }
   }
   ```
   - It prints details of the file system events or errors.

### Summary
- The code sets up a file system watcher using `notify` and handles file system events asynchronously with `futures`.
- It reads a directory path from command-line arguments and watches for changes in that directory.
- When changes are detected, the events are printed to the console.

This approach effectively combines asynchronous programming and file system monitoring to react to changes in real-time.
